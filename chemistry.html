<a name=1></a><b>CHEMISTRY&#160;(CLASSES XI –XII)</b><br/>
<b>RATIONALE</b><br/>
Higher Secondary Stage is the most crucial stage of school education because at this stage specialised<br/>discipline based, content oriented courses are introduced. Students reach this stage after 10 years of<br/>general education and opt for Chemistry with a purpose of mostly for pursuing their career in basic sciences<br/>or professional courses like medicines, engineering, technology and studying courses in applied areas of<br/>science and technology at tertiary level. Therefore, at this stage, there is a need to provide learners with<br/>sufficient conceptual background of Chemistry, which will make them competent to meet the challenges of<br/>academic and professional courses after the higher secondary stage.<br/>
National Curriculum Framework - 2005 recommends a disciplinary approach with appropriate rigour<br/>
and depth with the care that syllabus is not heavy and at the same time it is comparable to the international<br/>level. It emphasizes a coherent focus on important ideas within the discipline that are properly sequenced<br/>to optimize learning. It recommends that theoretical component of Higher Secondary Science should<br/>emphasize on problem solving methods and the awareness of historical development of key concepts of<br/>science be judiciously integrated into content. The present exercise of syllabus development in Chemistry<br/>at Higher Secondary Stage is based on this framework.<br/>
<b>Salient features of the present syllabus are thus:</b><br/>
•<br/>
Some background of Chemistry from secondary stage is assumed; however, no specific knowledge<br/>of topics in Chemistry is pre-supposed.<br/>
•<br/>
The course is self-contained and broadly covers fundamental concepts of Chemistry.<br/>
•<br/>
Attempt has been made to see discipline of Chemistry does not remain only the science of facts<br/>but becomes related to modern applications in the world around us.<br/>
•<br/>
The syllabus provides logical sequencing of the ‘Units’ of the subject matter with proper placement<br/>of concepts with their linkages for better understanding.<br/>
•<br/>
Emphasis has been on promoting process - skills, problem solving abilities and applications of<br/>concepts of Chemistry useful in real life situation for making learning of Chemistry more relevant,<br/>meaningful and interesting.<br/>
•<br/>
An effort has been made on the basis of feedback, to remove repetition besides reducing the<br/>content by suitably integrating the different content areas.<br/>
•<br/>
Practical syllabus has two components. There are core experiments to be undertaken by the<br/>students in the classroom and will be part of examination while each student will carry out one<br/>investigatory project and submit the report for the examination.<br/>
&#160;With this background, the Chemistry curriculum at the higher secondary stage attempts to<br/>
•<br/>
promote understanding of basic principles in Chemistry while retaining the excitement in Chemistry;<br/>
•<br/>
develop an interest in students to study Chemistry as discipline;<br/>
1<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2></a>•<br/>
strengthen the concepts developed at the secondary stage and to provide firm foundation for<br/>further learning of Chemistry at tertiary level more effectively;<br/>
•<br/>
develop positive scientific attitude, and appreciate contribution of Chemistry towards the<br/>improvement of quality of human life;<br/>
•<br/>
develop problem solving skills and nurture curiosity, aesthetic sense and creativity;<br/>
•<br/>
inculcate values of honesty, integrity, cooperation, concern for life and preservation of the<br/>environment;<br/>
•<br/>
make the learner realise the interface of Chemistry with other disciplines of science such as Physics,<br/>Biology, Geology, etc;<br/>
•<br/>
equip students to face challenges related to health, nutrition, environment, population, whether<br/>industries and agriculture.<br/>
