	1. Find the remainder when 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 7 is divided by
	
	(i) x - 2                                     (ii) x + 3  (iii) 2x + 1.
	
	2. When 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 10x - p is divided by (x + 1), the remainder is -24. Find the value of
	p.
	
	3. If (2x - 3) is a factor of 6x^2 + x + a, find the value of a. With this value of a, factorise
	the given expression.
	
	4. When 3x^2 - 5x + p is divided by (x - 2), the remainder is 3. Find the value of p. Also
	factorise the polynomial 3x^2 - 5x + p - 3.
	
	5. Prove that (5x + 4) is a factor of 5x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x - 4. Hence, factorise the given polynomial
	completely.
	
	6. Use factor theorem to factorise the following polynomials completely:
	
	(i) 4x^3 + 4x^2 - 9x - 9                                    (ii) x^3 - 19x - 30
	
	7. If x^3 - 2x^2 + px + q has a factor (x + 2) and leaves a remainder 9 when divided by
	(x + 1), find the values of p and q. With these values of p and q, factorise the given
	polynomial completely.
	
	8. If (x + 3) and (x - 4) are factors of x^3 + ax^2 - bx + 24, find the values of a and b. With
	these values of a and b, factorise the given expression.
	
	9. If (2x + 1) is a factor of both the expressions 2x^2 - 5x + p and 2x^2 + 5x + q, find the
	values of p and q. Hence, find the other factors of both the polynomials.
	
	10. If a polynomial f(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 3x^2 - ax - b leaves remainders 5 and 19 when divided
	by (x - 1) and (x + 1) find the values of a and b. Hence, determine the
	remainder when f(x) is divided by (x - 2).
	
	11. When a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x - 1), the remainder is 5 and when it is divided
	by (x - 2), the remainder is 7. Find the remainder when it is divided by (x - 1)(x - 2)
